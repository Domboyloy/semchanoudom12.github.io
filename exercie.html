      Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define
      paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five
      sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the
      unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a
      paragraph.
